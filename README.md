# SUSE manager / Uyuni ansible modules

These are a couple of ansible modules that I developed for SUSE manager / uyuni. Use them how you like and if you want to give me some credit if you find it usefull!

## How to use
There are two ways how you can use these modules:
1) Create a library folder in the place where your playbook is.
2) Create a collection and add it to the plugins/modules folder, that way you can call any of the modules in any roles that you specify in your collection

An example of method 1 is also in this repo.

## Side note

The modules are made by me so I can use suse manager/uyuni better in my day to day life. I am no programmer so 100% correct or efficient it will not be. But I thought let me share it with the wider world so maybe somebody else has some use to it.
